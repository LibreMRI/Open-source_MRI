# Open--source_MRI
Collaborative project for the development of open-source hardware in MRI

This repository aims to hosts hardware designs for MRI that are open-source or in the public domain, with the purpose to facilitate MRI research by providing robust solutions to research labs that do not possess the resources to develop specific hardware themselves. It is also an effort to create a resource that fully documents MRI systems and facilitates collaborative work so as to improve repeatability between research sites, which is an important issue in MRI. In the medium to long-term, this project may also lead to an entire open-source MRI system.

The folders at the root of this repository correspond to various parts of MRI scanners:
- Main magnet
- Gradient and shim coils
- Console
- Radiofrequency coils
- Transmission lines and baluns
- Gradient amplifier
- Radiofrequency amplifier
- Preamplifier
- Faraday cage
- Mains trigger
- Breathing trigger
- Cardiac trigger
- Pulse processing software
- Image processing software

The wiki can be used to give links to OSS projects related to MRI, or to provide information about hardware configurations that are working (or not).

Feel free to contact me if you wish to help with this project, contributions are welcome!
